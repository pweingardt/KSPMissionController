	// (mass cost mult starts per category, as below in CATERGORYMASSCOST, but can be modified
		// by modules; if it has a massCostMult, that's multiplied in to the running total mass cost mult.)
	// then for each resource the part has, res.maxAmount * RESOURCECOST[that resource].tank
	// is added.
	// finally, it's all multiplied by total cost mult (which starts as totalCostScalar).
	
	// for vessel cost, for each resource the vessel has, if there's a corresponding RESOURCECOST
