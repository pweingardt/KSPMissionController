	name = Bootstraps - Surface Infrastructure Mission Package
	description = This mission package focuses on programs involving the setup of base support infrastructure both in orbit around planetary bodies and on their surface. The target audience is experienced players who have completed the Interplanetary mission package or have the requisite skills to do so.\n\nBSP Added to MCE default download on version .53.  Boot Strap Missions was made by Ihavealamp His original thread can be found Here:\nSlight Modification were made mostly getting rid of the Launchgoals \n\nhttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/58576-0-22-Bootstraps-176-New-Missions-for-Mission-Controller-Extended-(v0-3-3)
